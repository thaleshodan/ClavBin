### ClavBin

Firewall Bash Tool

ClavBin is a terminal-based security and automation tool developed in Bash. It combines firewall features with a function assistant, allowing users to perform security tasks, network monitoring, and automation directly from the terminal—efficiently and without the need for graphical interfaces. Additionally, it provides fine-grained control over network connections and simplifies proxy configuration for anonymity.
Features

    Terminal Firewall: Controls system network traffic by allowing or blocking packets based on configurable filtering rules. The firewall is managed directly through the terminal, offering flexibility and high performance.

    Function Assistant: Includes a set of automation functions to make system administration easier, such as security checks, network traffic monitoring, and quick adjustments to network settings.

    Antivirus Scanning (Integrated with ClamAV): Performs system scans for malware and viruses using the ClamAV engine to ensure a clean environment.

    Proxychains Integration: Allows network traffic to be routed through a configurable chain of proxies, ensuring anonymity and increased security during online operations.
