## Firewalll Bash Tool


**ClavBin**is a terminal automation and security tool written in **Bash**. It combines firewall and function wizard functionality, allowing users to perform security, network monitoring, and automation tasks directly from the terminal, efficiently and without the need for graphical interfaces. In addition, it offers granular control over network connections and makes it easy to configure proxies for anonymity.








## Features

- **Terminal Firewall**: Controls network traffic on the system, allowing or blocking packets based on configurable filtering rules. The firewall is managed directly via the terminal, offering flexibility and high performance.

- **Function Wizard**: Offers a series of automation functions to facilitate system administration, such as security checks, network traffic monitoring and quick adjustments to network settings.

- **Antivirus Scanning (Integrated with ClamAV)**: Scans the system for malware and viruses, using the **ClamAV** engine to ensure that the environment is free of threats.

- **Integration with Proxychains**: Allows network traffic to be routed through a chain of configurable proxies, ensuring anonymity and greater security during browsing.

## Installation
