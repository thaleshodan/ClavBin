### ClavBin
Bash-Based Firewall Tool

ClavBin is a terminal-based security and automation tool developed in Bash. It combines firewall functionality with a system assistant, allowing users to perform security tasks, network monitoring, and automation efficiently—directly from the terminal, without the need for graphical interfaces. It also offers fine-grained control over network connections and simplifies proxy configuration for anonymity.
Features

    Terminal-Based Firewall: Controls system network traffic by allowing or blocking packets based on configurable filtering rules. The firewall is fully managed via the terminal, providing flexibility and high performance.

    System Assistant: Offers a collection of automation functions to support system administration tasks such as security checks, network traffic monitoring, and quick network configuration tweaks.

    Antivirus Scanning (Integrated with ClamAV): Scans the system for malware and viruses using the ClamAV engine to help ensure a threat-free environment.

    Proxychains Integration: Routes network traffic through a configurable chain of proxies, providing anonymity and enhanced security while browsing or performing network operations.

Installation
Requirements

    ClamAV: Used for virus and malware scanning. Make sure it's installed before running ClavBin.
